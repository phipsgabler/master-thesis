\chapter{Background}
\label{cha:background}

This section provides the background for the concepts used later in
chapters~\ref{cha:impl-dynam-graph} and \ref{cha:graph-track-prob}.  On the one hand, it gives a
quick overview of Baysian inference and probabilistic programming in general, necessary to
understand the requirements and usual approaches of probabilitic programming systems.

On the other hand, the machinery and language used to develop the graph tracking system forming the
main part of the work are described.  This consists firstly of a short introduction to graph
tracking and source-to-source automatic differentiation, which contain many ideas and terminology
that will be used later, and often provided inspiration.  Second, the basic notions and techniques
of the Julia compilation process, as well as the language's metaprogramming capabilities are
described, which form the basis of the implementation.

\section{Bayesian Inference and Probabilistic Programming}
\label{sec:bayes-infer-prob}

Probabilistic programming is a means of describing stochastic models through the syntax of a
programming language.  These models describe probability distributions as stochastic functions.
Probabilistic programms distinguish themselves from normal programs by the possibility of being
sampled from conditionally, with some of the internal variables fixed to observed values.  While
probabilistic programming systems are often implemented as separate, domain-specific languages, they
can also be embedded into \enquote{host} programming languages with sufficient syntactic
flexibility.  The latter is advantageous if one wants to use regular general-purpose programming
constructs or interact with other functionalities of the host language.
