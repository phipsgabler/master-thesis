\chapter{Implementation of Dynamic Graph Tracking in Julia}
\label{cha:impl-dynam-graph}

As described previously, there is a trade-off between source-transformation methods and
library-based (operator overloading) approaches for tracking computation graphs.  Since the ultimate
goal of this work is to analyze dynamic probabilistic models written in \turingjl{}, properties of
both are desireable.  An operator overloading approach has been considered, since it would have
allowed to potentially reuse AD implementations, but was thought insufficient, because the structure
of control flow and recursion are lost.  Inspired by the work of \textcite{innes2018don}, it seemed
most promising to start from a source-transformation based approach implemented over the IR,
especially from a usability point of view.  The advantages of using a transformation of the IR over
the surface AST are the same: there is less overhead from handling multiple syntactic forms, and
naming is already referentially transparent.  Additionally, there are existing Julia packages to
simplify handling the IR data structures and set up the transformations.

However, the dynamicity of the trace structure of general probabilistic programs needs to be
preserved and exposed to the user, for each function evaluation~-- which is different from the AD
usage, where the adjoint function is already the ultimate goal, and does not change with the
arguments.  Hence, a method for a hybrid version was developed: through an IR transformation, the
original code of a function to be tracked should be extended by additional statements to record a
trace of the executed statements and control flow operations at run-time.  The algorithm and
structures on which this approach is based have already been shortly described in
\textcite{gabler2019graph}, and will be explained more extensively below.  An open source
implementation is available
online\footnote{\protect\url{https://github.com/TuringLang/IRTracker.jl}}.

As we have seen above, in section~\ref{sec:comp-metapr-julia}, generated functions allow the
inspection and transformation of the IR of given functions.  This technique can be applied to
recursively traverse the implementation of a given function, annotating each operation with
necessary tracking statements, and changing the inputs and outputs accordingly to extract this
information from outside.  To ensure sufficient generality, we requite the following properties of
the tracking system:
\begin{enumerate}
  \firmlist
\item Storage of all intermediate values during execution.
\item Symbolic capture of intermediate expressions and branches in an analyzable, graphical form.
\item Preservation of the relation of each part of the structure to the corresponding original IR.
\item Proper nesting of this information for nested function calls, making relations between
  arguments and function inputs recoverable.
\item Correct handling of constants and primitive functions in the IR.
\item Extensibility of the tracking functions, to allow multiple possible ways to analyze code
  (e.g., by different definitions of what should be recorded).
\item A way to add custom metadata to the recorded structure during tracking.
\end{enumerate}
This kind of operation will be similar to the (explicit) construction of Wengert lists in
backwards-mode AD (see section~\ref{sec:cg-ad}); but contrary to there, the nested call structure
and control flow shall be preserved as well.  Hence, we call this structure \emph{extended Wengert
  list}.  

\section{Extended Wengert Lists}
\label{sec:exteded-wengert-lists}

The extended Wengert list structure is implemented in Julia through nested objects of an abstract
supertype \jlinl{AbstractNode}, with several concrete subtypes for the different kinds of nodes.
Additionally, there are special types for the tape- and block references, and an expression type
\jlinl{TapeExpression}, mimicking the built-in \jlinl{Expr}, but adding more semantic distinctions
(such as between references and constants, and between primitive and non-primitive function calls).
On top of this, an API to query the graph structure is provided, allowing, for example, to find all
children or parents of a tape reference up to a certain depth, or extract data from nodes, such as
referenced variables, arguments, or metadata.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/extended-wengert-list}
  \caption{Extended Wengert list for one run of the stochastic function geom (only three levels
    shown). The central box is the tracked graph of the call \protect\jlinl{geom(1, 0.6)}. The other
    boxes show the original IR of the called non-primitive functions, to which the nodes are
    linked.  Angle brackets indicate constant values.}
  \label{fig:ext-wengert-list}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ext-wengert-list} illustrates the resulting extended Wengert list for one run of a
short stochastic function:
\begin{lstlisting}
geom(n, beta) = rand() < beta ? n : geom(n + 1, beta)
\end{lstlisting}
(for readability, the result is displayed to only three levels of nesting).  The function draws a
sample from the geometric distribution with parameter \jlinl{beta}, starting to count at value
\jlinl{n}. On the left, we have its IR in textual form, consisting of two blocks. The central part
is the graph of nested nodes.  There, values and jumps from the top-level call are recorded in their
encountered order, as nodes with \enquote{tape references} \jlinl{@1} to \jlinl{@9}. SSA variables
(\jlinl{\%i}) occurring in expressions of SSA definitions are also replaced in the nodes by the
respective tape references.  Each node is linked to the original IR statement it records, as
indicated by the red arrows.

In the lower middle part, we see the node corresponding to the statement \jlinl{\%7 = geom(\%6,
  \%3)}.  It is recorded at reference \jlinl{@8} with expression \jlinl{geom(@7, @3)} and value
\jlinl{4} (the notation \jlinl{⟨geom⟩} indicates that \jlinl{geom} is a constant, and \jlinl{()...}
stands for the absence of optional arguments). The values of the arguments of this call can be
inspected by looking up the respective references.  Since \jlinl{geom} is not a primitive function,
the node holds tape of child nodes as well.  In this case, it is equivalent to the top level, due to
the recursivity of \jlinl{geom}. We can see the three arguments \jlinl{@1}, \jlinl{@2}, and
\jlinl{@3}, corresponding to the block arguments \jlinl{\%1}, \jlinl{\%2}, and \jlinl{\%3}, with the
value of \jlinl{@2} being now \jlinl{2} instead of \jlinl{1}.  Further we can see function calls of
\jlinl{rand} and \jlinl{<} as well as a conditional jump, corresponding to the branch the original
IR, followed by calls of \jlinl{+} and \jlinl{geom}. Following back the tape references from the
result value \jlinl{@9}, the data path of the trace can be extracted.  It can be used for
reverse-mode AD, and only these nodes would be recorded in a conventional Wengert list.  In this
work, however, the system also records the nodes on the control path, consisting of \jlinl{@6} and
the nodes it depends on.


\section{Automatic Graph Tracking}
\label{sec:autom-graph-track}

Recording an extended Wengert list requires to capture all block arguments, SSA definitions, and
taken branches, with their actual values and metadata. This is achieved by extending the IR with new
statements creating nodes and recording them on the extended Wengert list structure described in the
previous section. Care needs to be taken to properly record function calls, since we need to ensure
that non-primitive functions are recursively tracked.

The recording functionality is implemented as a transformation using a generated function operating
on the IR, using the \juliapackage{IRTools.jl} package, as described in
section~\ref{sec:comp-metapr-julia}.  The resulting IR consists of about three to five times as many
statements as the original. This is a small constant overhead per statement, but should not affect
complexity using proper implementation techniques, such as a good choice of collection structures
and paying attention to type stability.  The basic blocks and control structure are preserved,
except for the redirection of return statements to the one block at the end.  Due to JIT
compilation, the transformation is performed at most a constant number of times per method, and then
stored as compiled code.  However, the tracking~-- the recording of all statements in the extended
Wengert list structure~-- happens at every execution during run-time, which is an important feature
to allow the application to dynamic models..  Furthermore, the extended code is available to all
standard optimizations performed in the following passes of type inference and lowering.

The transformed code of the example function \jlinl{geom}, whose untracked IR is given in
figure~\ref{fig:ext-wengert-list} above at the sides, is displayed in figure~\ref{fig:geom-tracked}.
First, a \enquote{graph recorder} object is passed into the function via the extra argument
\jlinl{\%5}.  In this, the original IR is stored for later access.  Subsequently, every original SSA
statement is replaced by a call to one of the \protect\jlinl{trackedX} functions, to which both the
function and its arguments, wrapped into \jlinl{TapeExpression}s directly (for constants) or
indirectly (through \jlinl{trackedvariable} and \jlinl{trackedargument}, which preserve the symbolic
mapping to SSA variables).  The \jlinl{record!}  function takes care of constructing the child node
of the possibly nested call, and storing them on the recorder object.

\begin{figure}[p]

  \caption{Tracked IR of the method \protect\jlinl{geom(::Int, ::Float64)}.  Corresponding parts in
    original and transformed IR are highlighted in matching colors.  (The original IR consists of
    two blocks, shown separately on the right.)\label{fig:geom-tracked}}
\end{figure}
\todo{make sure figure is on same spread as explanation}

To get a more detailed understanding, consider the SSA statement \jlinl{\%6 = \%2 + 1} in the second
block of \jlinl{geom}, which describes the application of the function \jlinl{+} to an SSA variable
and a constant.  The IR of the block is shown again in \ref{fig:geom-tracked} on the box on the
lower right, with corresponding pieces of IR highlighted in matching colors (\jlinl{\%6} being
transformed into \jlinl{\%33} to \jlinl{\%37} on the left).
\begin{enumerate}
  \firmlist
\item First, a constant node \jlinl{\%33} for the function is set up.
\item Then, the variable argument in is tracked in \jlinl{\%34}.  There, \jlinl{trackedvariable} has
  the purpose to correctly relate the node in the trace (\jlinl{@2}) to the original SSA variable
  \jlinl{\%6}.  This is necessary since a block could be visited multiple times during tracking~--
  for example, if it belongs to a loop body~-- which requires to give multiple, unique names to
  references to the same original variable.  Additionally, \jlinl{trackedvariable} copies values,
  since the tracked information would otherwise no preserve intermediate values correctly in the
  case of mutations.
\item Next, both of the function arguments are packed into the tuple \jlinl{\%35}; the second
  argument, which was a literal value \jlinl{1} in the original IR, is preserved as a literal as
  well (wrapped into a \jlinl{QuoteNode} object for technical reasons).
\item Finally, the function and arguments are passed to the function \jlinl{trackedcall}, which
  takes care of actually calling the original function.  Doing so, it will, if the called function is
  not considered primitive, recursively track it as well, and pack the resulting child nodes into a
  new nested node, together with the return value.  Otherwise, the result will simply be stored in a
  special primitive-call node.
\item The resulting node is then stored on the recorder; this operation at the same time returns the
  value, \jlinl{\%37}, which is needed in subsequent calculations (in this case, in \jlinl{\%39}, as
  the argument of the recursive call to \jlinl{geom}).
\end{enumerate}
Branches, tracked with \jlinl{trackejump} and \jlinl{trackedreturn}, cannot be stored on the
recorder object before the respective jumps are taken.  The solution is to first construct the
respective nodes of all possible branches of a block (\jlinl{\%28}), and adding them as an extra
argument to the old branches.  Then, in each target branch, the jump node from which the branch
originated is recorded immediately (in this case, in statement \jlinl{\%32}).  As a special case,
all return branches are converted to unconditional jumps to one new block at the end, which contains
a single unified return branch.  (For illustration, \jlinl{\%28} and \jlinl{\%30}, the branch
variables of block 1, are highlighted in colors matching to the original branches in
figure~\ref{fig:geom-tracked}.)  This way, return branches can be treated in the same way as internal
branches.  An more formal description in pseudo-code is given in algorithm~\ref{alg:ir-transform}.

Lastly, some special dispatch is used for the transformation to work correctly on certain special
kinds of function calls, such as built-in functions, type application, and \texttt{ccall}
primitives, which require more careful handling.  These functions are detected and replaced by
\jlinl{trackedspecial} tracking statements appropriately.

\end{algorithm}

To provide some modularity and extensibility to the system, it also affords customization of some
behavior by \emph{tracing contexts}.  All of the \jlinl{trackedX} functions explained above, used
directly in the transformed code, are really special methods that work directly on the recorder
object.  Their behavior~-- namely, performing the actual method calls and constructing the nodes~--
is defined in another method of the same function, which dispatches on a context object stored in
the recorder object, and can be overloaded by the user for a custom context.  

\begin{lstfloat}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=lstfloat]
struct DepthLimitContext <: AbstractTrackingContext
    level::Int
    maxlevel::Int
end

DepthLimitContext(maxlevel) = DepthLimitContext(1, maxlevel)
canrecur(ctx::DepthLimitContext, f, args...) = ctx.level < ctx.maxlevel

function trackednested(ctx::DepthLimitContext, f_repr::TapeValue,
                       args_repr::ArgumentTuple{TapeValue}, info::NodeInfo)
    new_ctx = DepthLimitContext(ctx.level + 1, ctx.maxlevel)
    return recordnestedcall(new_ctx, f_repr, args_repr, info)
end
\end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Implementation of a tracking context to limit the nesting depth to a maximum (which is
    part of the implemented package).\label{lst:depthlimitcontext}}
\end{lstfloat}

This allows, for one, to overload the notion of what constitutes a \emph{primitive function}.  In
the default context, primitive functions are only those that do not have IR on their own (such as
intrinsics and functions defined in C), which leads to very large recursive traces.  To circumvent
this, we can introduce a new \jlinl{DepthLimitContext}, as shown in
listing~\ref{lst:depthlimitcontext}.  There, the function \jlinl{canrecur} is overloaded to stop at
depth \jlinl{maxlevel}; this method will be called to determine whether a tracked function is
considered primitive.  Besides this, we also have to redefine the behavior of \jlinl{trackednested}
to specify that for non-primitive functions, i.e., nested calls, the level remembered in the context
object should be updated.  \jlinl{recordnestedcall} is a built-in function of the library that
simply performs the recursive tracking, then.

From this we see that \jlinl{trackedcall} is only a thin wrapper around a conditional statement over
\jlinl{canrecur}, \jlinl{trackednested}, and its sibling \jlinl{trackedprimitive}.  Beyond this,
context dispatch allows a user to change any other of the tracking functions as well.  This can be
used to store custom metadata, calculate information during tracking, or even change return values
or nesting dynamically.  In addition to those methods, also \jlinl{trackedargument},
\jlinl{trackedreturn}, and \jlinl{trackedjump} can be customized, which we have seen in the example;
furthermore, there are \jlinl{trackedspecial}, \jlinl{trackedconstant}, and \jlinl{trackederror}.
\jlinl{trackedvariable} is more primitive and cannot be overloaded, since this would change the
relation between references of tracked nodes.  More information is available on the package's public
repository.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:irtracker-eval}

The extended Wengert list created by tracking a function can be used for many purposes in which
computation graphs are required.  All algorithms that can be formulated as message-passing can
directly work on this, as well as all methods that operate on run-time dependency graphs, from
simple debugging to concolic execution (see discussion below).

As a proof of concept, a small backward-mode AD system was implemented in the form of a context.
This simply required storing the derivative operators for all intermediate values during the forward
pass, and writing a backward pass as graph traversal on the resulting computation
graph.\footnote{\href{https://github.com/TuringLang/IRTracker.jl/blob/760143734de1bf4e90da655d833e7999fc0ab2de/test/test_backward_ad.jl}{\url{https://github.com/TuringLang/IRTracker.jl/blob/master/test/test_backward_ad.jl}}}
The implementation has been tested on some simple composed functions, but is not intended for
serious application.  Due to the very abstract nature of the implementation, not more individual
evaluations of it are performed, except unit tests to ensure basic correctness of the interface.
The approach discussed in chapter~\ref{cha:graph-track-prob} illustrates a more realistic use-case
of the proposed system, and serves thus a larger integration test.

More potential use cases arise when the tracked model is actually static~-- in this case, the
complete structure can be recovered from one graph tracking pass.  This graph can then be analyzed
and used in various ways; even more so, when more semantic knowledge about the model program exists,
such as meanings of certain domain-specific functions.  Examples of this are conjugacy detection as
described by \textcite{hoffman2018autoconj}, and automatic Rao-Blackwellization as in
\textcite{murray2017delayed}.

% Specifically, two show-cases for the system, applied to probabilistic programs written in
% \turingjl{} were considered: Due to the additional complexity required for them, only the
% automatic derivation of Gibbs conditionals, as shown in the next chapter, was finally executed,
% though.

The implementation is limited in two respects.  First, in practical terms, there are some trade-offs
to be made regarding the storage of intermediate results and functions in nodes.  In the current
design, nodes are parameterized by the types of their contents, which leads to very large types, and
potential slow-down during type inference.  Not doing this would prevent type stability of the
transformed code, since all of the intermediate values that are passed directly in the original code
are wrapped in node structures and unwrapped again.  There are even still some cases in which the
parametrization does not eliminate type instability.  Alternatively, original values could be passed
unwrapped into the \jlinl{trackedcall} functions, besides the node arguments; this would lead to
more complicated handling of values, though.

The other, more fundamental restriction is inherent to dynamic tracing: alternative paths, that were
not taken due to run-time control flow, are not recorded.  Compared to a traditional operator
overloading system, \irtrackerjl{} does preserve the information about which branches were taken,
and for which reason in the case of conditional branches, but this is not enough for complete static
analysis in all cases.

One possible direction for extension is concolic execution \parencite{zeller2019concolic}, in which
the function is traced multiple times with different arguments, whose exact values are determined by
constraint solving so that all possible execution paths are covered.  This is potentially slow, and
goes against the spirit of the idea of tracking once, in parallel to the normal forward execution.
Also, it is not applicable to general user-defined types, but constrained to whatever theories the
used SMT solver supports.  Alternatively, a method to merge control paths in the transformed
function could be conceived.  This might, however, suffer from exponential blow-up in several cases,
is difficult to get right in the presence of mutation, and has complicated theoretical properties
(e.g., termination of the resulting code might be undecidable).

As another future direction, it is conceivable that a composable context system could be designed,
such that, for example, one could perform automatic differentiation and dependency graph tracking
within one tracking pass.  However, this would require more careful design, since it is unclear how
to deal with potential non-commutativity or non-associativity of the effects of contexts in
different orders (e.g., which one gains priority in the decision about nested or primitive
tracking).
