  \noindent This thesis proposes a novel approach for the implementation of a tracking system to
  facilitate program analysis, based on program transformations. The system is then applied to a
  specific problem in the field of probabilistic programming.

  The main contribution is a general system for the extraction of rich computation graphs in the
  Julia programming language, based on a transformation of the intermediate representation (IR) used
  by the compiler.  These graphs contain the whole recursive structure of any Julia program in terms
  of executed IR instructions.  The system is flexible enough to be used for multiple purposes that
  require dynamic program analysis or abstract interpretation, such as automatic differentiation or
  dependency analysis.

  The second part of the thesis describes the application of this graph tracking system to
  probabilistic programs written for Turing, a probabilistic programming system implemented as an
  embedded language within Julia.  Through this, an executed Turing model can be analyzed, and the
  dependency structure of involved random variables be extracted from it.  Given this structure,
  analytical Gibbs conditionals can be calculated and passed to Turing's inference mechanism, where
  they are used in Markov-Chain Monte Carlo samplers approximating the modelled distribution.
